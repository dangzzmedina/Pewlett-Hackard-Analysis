# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
* The purpose of this analysis is to create relationships from different files to distill the data to provide me with a clean filtered result. This way I could be able know which employees are in retirement-age group and which current title they hold. This way the company can know which employees are eligible to the mentorship program. This will help Bobby try and sell his analysis to retain as much of employees possible to mentor the new hires before they leave. I personally learned how to apply ERD's using SQL within PGAdmin 4 to be able to extract data from different files to create their relationships to bring a clean filtered result.
## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* 1. There is only 1 Manager who holds the Manager Title. Is the information correct for the Managers? Is the company using an outdated title?
* 2. There is a big number of employees in the Senior Engineering and Staff positions that will be retiring soon. The company should focus on hiring new and current exmployees with engineering backgrounds.
* Looking at the number of current employees who are in the edge of retiring (birthdates in the year 1965) is 1500. If the company will most likely lose a big quantity of knowledgeable individuals next year if they do not transition them to a mentorship program.
*  Most of the current exmployees who are in the edge of retiring are Senior Engineers and Staff titled.
## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* Around 1500 roles.
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
*  There are enough qualified employees in the departments to mentor the first wave of the silver tsunami. But, the company has around 67,000 senior holding positions. The company should start hiring new employees and current employees. Most departments have more than 1800 employees ready to be mentored. If the company retains most of the seniors leaving at least for a year the company can start retaining retirees at least for a while to be able to mentor new employees.
